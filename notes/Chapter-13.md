## **Border, Margin & Padding**
Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:

**1: Border**
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

**2: Margin**
Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of tow adjacent boxes.

**3: Padding**
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.

**Please Note:** If a width is specified for a box, padding is added onto the width of the box.

The **margin** property controls the gap between boxes.

**Please Note:** If the margin of a box is specified then the margin is added to the width of the box.

If you want to center a box the page (or center it inside the element that it sits in), you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.

In order to center a box on the page, you need to set a width for the box (otherwise it will take up the full width of the page).

Once you have specified the width of the box, setting the left and right margins of auto will make the browser put an equal gap on each side of the box.

## **Change Inline/Block**
**Display:**
The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.

**Inline:**
This causes a block-level element to act like an inline element.

**Block:**
This causes an inline element to act like a block-level element.

**none:**
This hides an element from the page. In this case, the element acts as though it is not one the page at all.
